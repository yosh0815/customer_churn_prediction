This machine learning project identifies which customers are likely to churn based on their usage and demographic data. By predicting customer churn in advance, businesses can take proactive retention measures and reduce revenue loss.

## Overview

- **Goal:** Predict whether a customer will churn using historical data
- **Model:** XGBoost, Logistic Regression
- **Performance:** Achieved an AUC-ROC score of **0.895** on the test set
- **Business Impact:** Helps reduce churn through targeted customer retention campaigns

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
